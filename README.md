# Living in the Czech Republic: real estate market analysis and investment prospects

The project was created as part of the Digital Academy: Data - Spring 2024 in cooperation with Saltanat K. 

The project was created to analyze the real estate market in the Czech Republic. We have investigated the cost of renting and buying property in different regions of the Czech Republic during the period of 2019-2024. 
Also, analyzing the Czech real estate market and its investment attractiveness, we decided to evaluate alternative investment options and determine the potential profit we could receive in 2024 if we invested a certain amount in 2019 in real estate or stocks. 
For the analysis, we used data from finance.yahoo and the Czech Statistical Office (https://vdb.czso.cz/). The values were converted into indices using Python code. 

# Python
